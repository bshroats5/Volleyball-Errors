# Volleyball-Errors

Created this repo to illustrate the errors made by the Eastern Kentucky University Volleyball team during the 2023 season. 

Entered the data from NCAA.Com and EKUSports.com that I needed and put it into an Google Sheets file. Then coded out the graph I wanted using Python

I wanted to see if there was a dramatic dffference in the number of errors made by the team when the lost vs when they won. ALso when they played at home vs on the road. 

While the errors were higher on the road and in defeats I did not find it to be a big increase like I thought.
